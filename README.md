# Text Classification Using LSTM and Skip-gram Vectorization

Text classification project using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model and text vectorization with the Skip-gram technique. The task is to classify text data into 20 labels, and the project allows for hyperparameter tuning and modifications to the LSTM architecture.
